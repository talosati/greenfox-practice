//Create a Student class that has the same fields and methods as the Person class, and has the following additional
//
//    fields:
//    previousOrganization: the name of the studentâ€™s previous company / school
//    skippedDays: the number of days skipped from the course
//    methods:
//    getGoal(): prints out "Be a junior software developer."
//    introduce(): "Hi, I'm name, a age year old gender from previousOrganization who skipped skippedDays
//    days from the course already."
//    skipDays(numberOfDays): increases skippedDays by numberOfDays
//    The Student class has the following constructors:
//    Student(name, age, gender, previousOrganization): beside the given parameters, it sets skippedDays to 0
//    Student(): sets name to Jane Doe, age to 30, gender to female, previousOrganization
//    to The School of Life, skippedDays to 0

//Every Object has a clone() method (so all of your classes will have an inherited one too), but by default it doesn't do anything.
//    Get your Student and other relevant classes from the Green Fox Organization Exercise
//    Override and implement the clone() method, so it clones the student.
//    Cloning means: create an independent copy with the same attributes (fields).
//    Instantiate John, a 20 years old male from BME
//    Clone him into jonhTheClone
